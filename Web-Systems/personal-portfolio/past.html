        <h3>Academic</h3>
        <p class="text_col">In 2022, I finished my HSC and graduated from xxx high school. The subjects I studied for the HSC were English Advanced, Maths Standard, Business Studies, PDHPE, and IST.  Exploring IST during this time interested me, which influenced my decision to pursue cybersecurity at UTS.</p>

        <h3>Extra-curricular</h3>
        <p class="text_col"> Since my early years, I've been involved in a diverse range of sports, including swimming, dance, badminton, martial arts, and gymnastics. Among these, martial arts has definitely captured my heart the most. Unfortunately, due to the impact of COVID-19, I had to stop my involvement in sports and 
currently find myself not actively participating in any. However, I am eagerly looking forward to joining some of the sports societies at UTS.

    <div class="experience">
        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <p class="text_col">During my time studying IST in high school, I gained valuable experience through various projects and practical applications. These experiences provided me with hands-on opportunities to develop technical skills in areas such as coding, software development, and IT systems management. Additionally, I had the opportunity to apply these skills in a professional setting, where I worked at a xxx company and provided basic IT support when required. </p>
