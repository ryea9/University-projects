<h4 class="h4_title">1. header</h4>

<p class="h4_para">The website maintains a consistent header across all pages, achieved by enclosing it within a div element. This header features the website's title, 'Web Systems,' implemented with the h1 element. The header is also styled using the .header class in the CSS file. The container class defines the width of the webpage's content. Its purpose is to enhance readability by preventing text from spanning the entire page width.</p>
<br>

<p class="h4_para">The header also consists of the naviagtion links which allow the user to go from one page to another. This is done by using the div element with the class name “nav”. Inside this div, there are multiple a (anchor) elements, each representing a link to a different page of the website. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page to which the link points. These links are the "Home", "Past", "Future", and "Comments" pages. When users click on these links, they will be directed to the respective pages of the website. The navigation bar serves as a user-friendly way to navigate between different sections or pages of the website. </p>
<br>

<p class="h4_para">The .nav in the CSS file ensures that the navigation links are displayed horizontally and have a consistent layout. By setting the background color, text color, padding, and other properties, it creates a visually distinct and interactive menu that enhances the user experience. Additionally, the hover effect changes the background and text color of the links when they are hovered over, providing visual feedback to the user. </p>

<h4 class="h4_title">2. content</h4>
<p class="h4_para">The main content of the webpage includes a title “About Me” using the h1 tag and and a paragraph using the p tag to introduce the contents of the website. The "section" element provides a structural division, while the "section_container" class helps organize the content within it. The .description used in the CSS class is used to style the placing of the text. For example, the margin is used to control the spacing between the description and other elements on the page, ensuring enough separation for clarity. The ".section_container" class utilizes flexbox to align the content vertically within its container, enhancing the layout's aesthetics and structure. Meanwhile, the ".content" class sets the width of the content area and adjusts its padding to ensure proper alignment and spacing. The comments page you're currently viewing uses the id attribute, like id=comment_para, for the description below the "comments" title. Each id is unique, ensuring that CSS can target this element specifically without confusing it with other classes. Additional CSS styling is then applied using #comment_para to customize the margin and size of the text.</p>


<h4 class="h4_title">3. footer</h4>
<p class="h4_para">The footer, present on all pages, serves as a consistent navigation aid for users. By using a div element with the class, 'footer,' it consists of navigation links, allowing users to conveniently switch between pages without having to scroll to the header navigation links. The footer's appearance and alignment are controlled by CSS classes, with 'footer' defining attributes like background color, padding, and text alignment. Additionally, the 'footer-links' class ensures proper styling and spacing for the navigation links, enhancing user experience and maintaining visual consistency throughout the website. Furthermore, when users hover over the navigation links, a subtle box-shadow transition effect is applied, providing visual feedback and enhancing interactivity.</p>

<h2 class="h2_title">Aesthetics</h2>
<p class="aes_para">The main aim of this website was to maintain simplicity, ensuring ease of navigation and usability.
</p>

<h3 class="h3_title">Color</h3>

<div class="cont-container">
<ul class="aesthetic">
    <li>The color scheme remained consistent throughout the website.</li>
    <li>Subheadings employed lighter variations of the main heading colors for enhanced visual appeal.</li>
    <li>Darker shades were selected for the background of headers and footers to ensure uniformity.</li>
    <li>Lighter tones were applied to text elements set against dark backgrounds. For example, the header and footer featured dark backgrounds, while the heading "Web Systems" and navigation links were rendered in lighter hues to provide contrast, enhancing readability for users.</li>
    <li>The navigation links change to the color white when the user hovers over it, indicating the's responsiveness.</li> 
    <li>Box shadow is applied on the "past experiences" page and around some images to add depth and create a floating effect.</li>
    <li>CSS properties such as “color” and “background-color" were utilized to style elements.</li>
</ul>   
</div>

<div class="color_pal">
    <img src="comments-color.PNG" alt="Color Palette">
</div>

<h3 class="h3_title">Font</h3>

<ul class="aesthetic">
    <li>Tahoma, sans-serif font, is employed consistently across the website for its simplicity and readability, ensuring ease of comprehension for users.</li>
    <li>This font was also selected because it's widely supported by most web browsers, ensuring consistent display across different platforms and devices.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3_title">Interactivity</h3>

<ul class="aesthetic">
    <li>In the CSS file, the ".nav a hover" class has properties like color, ensuring that when users hover over the navigation links in the header, they receive visual feedback by the color changing to white, indicating the website's responsiveness. </li>
    <li>The footer incorporates a similar feature with the ".footer-links a:hover" class, employing the box-shadow property to generate a shadow effect when users hover over these links.</li>
   
</ul>

<div class="interactivity-image">

</div>

 

<h3 class="h3_title">Structure</h3>
    
    <ul class="structure">
    <li>The website layout follows a vertical structure. By setting the max-width property, I could limit the width of the page, preventing content from spanning the entire width. Additionally, utilizing the width property within the container class ensured that the content stayed within the page width, maintaining a neat presentation.</li>
    <li>On the home page and future page, the text is aligned to the right and images are placed on the left side to maintain a tidy and readable layout.</li>
    <li>On the "Past Experiences" page, I created a three-column structure and placed each subheading in a box to maintain a consistent layout for that page.</li>
    </ul>



<h2 class="h2_title">Accessibility</h2>

<p class="access_para"><strong>Font-selection</strong>The alt attribute is used to improve accessibility by providing alternative text descriptions for images, which can be read aloud by screen readers. By including descriptive alt text, visually impaired users can understand the content and context of images, even if they cannot see them. This allows them to navigate the website more easily and access the same information as sighted users. Additionally, alt text is beneficial in situations where images fail to load properly, providing a fallback description of the content.</p>

<p class="access_para"><strong>Width for container elements-</strong> By setting a maximum width for container elements such as header, navigation menu, wrapper, and footer, the content of the website is constrained within a certain width. This prevents content from stretching too wide on large screens, which can make it difficult for users to read. It also ensures that the content remains visually organized and manageable.</p>


<p class="access_para"><strong>Hover</strong> The hover feature in CSS improves accessibility for visually impaired users by providing visual feedback when they interact with elements on a webpage. When a user hovers their mouse over the navigation links, the element changes background color. This change in appearance serves as a visual cue to the user that the element is interactive and can be clicked or activated. Similarly, the footer also has navigation links with a hover feature.</p>


<p class="access_para"><strong>Screen size</strong> Screen size adjustments were made using "@media only screen and (max-width: 600px)". This allowed me to adapt font sizes, padding, margins, and other elements to ensure accessibility on devices of all sizes.</p>
